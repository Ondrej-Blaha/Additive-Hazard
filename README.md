# Additive-Hazard: R Code

Simulation code calculating sample size and estimating type I error and power of the underlying treatment effect test under the additive hazard mixed model
for clustered survival data.
This code is provided by the authors to the reviewers, scientific community, and general public at large as a part of their submission of paper titled:
"Design and analysis of cluster randomized trials with time-to-eventoutcomes under the additive hazards mixed model" to the Statistics in Medicine Journal.

This code is expanding on work of professors Cai and Zeng and is inspired by their MatLab code which was translated into R as the basis of our new development.
Authors would like to hereby thank prof Cai and prof Zeng for their kind cooperation and providing us with their Matlab script.
